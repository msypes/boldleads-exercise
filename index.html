    <h1>Entry Page for one &amp; all</h1>
    <p>This page exists merely a cheap way of directing potential clients/leads
        and realtors to their own unique pages.
    </p>
    <p>If this were an actual application, there'd a be a login
        to establish permission sets for access to appropriate pages,
        and the client form might actually exist here.
